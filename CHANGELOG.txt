Breaking changes:

- Renamed `:re-db/sync-tx` to `:re-db.sync/tx` for consistency

- in re-db.sync.client:
  - renamed `on-handshake!` to `on-open`
  - renamed `$query` to `$watch`
  - removed `all`
  - `$watch`, ``$all` now take `channel` as 1st parameter
  - messages are no longer queued before connection. We already keep track of active queries and re-initialize
    on re-connect, this should be sufficient.
  - added `on-close` fn for clean-up
  - removed `transact-txs`
- in re-db.sync.server:
  - renamed `watch-ref` to `watch`
  - renamed `unwatch-ref` to `unwatch`
  - if a ref's value has `:re-db.sync/snapshot` metadata, it will be sent
    as a starting value when a new client starts a watch.
- moved transit code to `re-db.sync.transit`
- moved diffing code to `re-db.sync.entity-diff-1`
- `re-db.subscriptions/subscription` accepts optional not-found parameter,
  otherwise throws if id is not registered.
- added `re-db.subscriptions/defonce`
- changed the format of server->client messages to `[operation ref-id & args]`
- added `on-dispose` hook
- `re-db.xform/transform` is now lazy
- reactions now permit invalidation outside a reactive context.
  this was due to frequent issues with inadvertent dereferencing (eg. often by Clerk, but not only).
  Remains an open question how to handle these lifecycles well.


Other changes:

- migrate-watches adds watches before dereferencing the destination rx
- reagent integration is now cljc
